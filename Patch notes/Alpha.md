Added methods that collects ranked game data and analyzes them

I'm planning on using class that contains informations about the match, the user, and the analyzed data

The bot works without compile errors!!!

/track and /untrack methods work well

idk if bot updates well when a ranked game happens as there is nothing to update now

can only stack informations, cannot show collected infos to others yet
