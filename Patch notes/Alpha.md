## August 3 ##

Fixed bugs and bot works as intended. But requires a way to avoid byte limits.

Added more functions

## July 26 ##

The bot is still in alpha, as most of the analysis part (especially custom length analysis)

Needs to work on how to send less than 2000 bytes all time

## July 23 ##

Added methods that collects ranked game data and analyzes them

I'm planning on using class that contains informations about the match, the user, and the analyzed data

## July 19 ##
The bot works without compile errors!!!

/track and /untrack methods work well

idk if bot updates well when a ranked game happens as there is nothing to update now

can only stack informations, cannot show collected infos to others yet
